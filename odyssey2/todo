terrain.frag snowBlend should use normal.y or 1 - normal.y depending on texture type (snow/rock)
Make fog shader separate http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-14-render-to-texture/#creating-the-render-target 

Terrain generation:
Vary filter strength with altitude?
Save result to file?
Make texture repetition less obvious. Detail map with randomness spanning several repetitions?

Optimization: 
Don't draw vertices outside frustum
Potentially optimize generate_terrain array sizes (store only y coordinates?)

Move input code out of Camera class
Potentially move VAO ID from Shader to Model

Add jumping

Fix window resize under Ubuntu 23.04. Resizing the window currently forces the window into minimum size, full screen button does nothing.

Set light direction and intensity based on skybox (scene)

Reflect terrain in water (second pass that draws over skybox reflection?)

Check if performance has changed after latest changes

Should terrain_shader be split into one shader for each terrain type? That would remove need for if statements in the shader

Why is there a skybox model floating outside the terrain? Visible if "real" skybox rendering is disabled.
