Diamond-square:
Decide what to do with diamond square parameters
Implement spline interpolation
Change arrays to double indices?
Sliding window average for terrain smoothing?

Optimization: Don't draw vertices outside frustum. Decrease detail level of far away vertices. GLM SIMD? Common libs modified?
generateTerrain: Test GenerateNormals from loadobj? Optimize by reducing new and LoadDataToModel operations if possible (loadStbTextureRef in initTerrain also slow, but not possible to optimize?)
Add wave effect to water surface
Add image to the Github page, link to learnopengl? Windows only?
Decide which texture maps to use
Use viewing angle dot sun direction to blind player if looking into the sun?
