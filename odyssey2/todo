terrain.frag snowBlend should use normal.y or 1 - normal.y depending on texture type (snow/rock)
How to make independent fog shader?

Diamond-square:
Change arrays to double indices?
Vary filter strength with altitude?
Save result to file?
How to make texture repetition less obvious?

Optimization: 
Don't draw vertices outside frustum
Optimize terrain array size (store only y coordinates?)
DrawModel: glGetAttribLocation calls should only be needed once?
