Decide which texture maps to use

Shaders:
Rewrite shader lighting
Shaders in view coordinates: https://learnopengl.com/code_viewer.php?code=lighting/basic_lighting-exercise2
Add shader for long-distance fog
Make geometry shader visualizing normal vectors. How to create grass with geometry shader?

Water:
Add wave effect to water surface

Diamond-square:
Decide what to do with diamond square parameters
Implement spline interpolation

Optimization: Don't draw vertices outside frustum. Decrease detail level of far away vertices. Decrease lighting quality for far away vertices? GLM SIMD? Common libs modified?
generateTerrain: Test GenerateNormals from loadobj? Optimize by reducing new and LoadDataToModel operations if possible (loadStbTextureRef in initTerrain also slow, but not possible to optimize?)
Test back face culling impact on performance
