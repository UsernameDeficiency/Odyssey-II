# Odyssey-II
Odyssey II is an OpenGL application that lets the user walk or fly around in a procedurally generated 3D world. The terrain generation is based on the diamond-square algorithm.

The project uses the GLM, GLFW and GLAD libraries. Compilation can be done through a Visual Studio 2019 solution for Windows and a makefile for Linux systems.

See odyssey2/tex/readme_textures.txt for notes regarding the included textures and skyboxes.
